## Strange Side-Effects

This section is about some strange side-effects of messing up Chess as much as we have.

### Homodirectional En Passant

As pawns from different players can travel in the same direction, En Passant can be performed by homodirectional pawns. Here, the attacking pawn must still move to the spot in between the starting and ending position of the other pawn.

### Two Take En Passant

If one player's pawn takes an initial move of 2, then another player moves a piece (e.g. bishop) in between the pawn's starting and ending position, then a third player's pawn takes the second player's piece, the third player's pawn will take both the other pieces.
